# FastSLAM Implementation for Pioneer P3-DX

This repository contains a FastSLAM implementation for the Pioneer P3-DX mobile robot, developed as part of the Autonomous Systems (SAut) course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico.

## Key Features
- FastSLAM 1.0/2.0 implementation in Python
- Simulation environment using `micro_simulator.py`
- Designed for the Pioneer P3-DX platform
- Includes sensor noise modeling and data association

## Project Context
Developed for educational purposes in robotic navigation and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). The implementation demonstrates:
- Particle filtering for pose estimation
- Extended Kalman Filters for landmark tracking
- Real-time performance considerations
